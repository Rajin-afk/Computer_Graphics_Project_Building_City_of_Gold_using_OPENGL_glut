# Building City of Gold using OpenGL and GLUT

This project is an interactive 3D representation of a city called "City of Gold" created using OpenGL and GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit). The goal of the project is to showcase the use of computer graphics techniques to render a virtual city with various architectural elements.

## Features

- Rendering of a virtual city with buildings and roads.
- The city features two temples with different designs.
- The land and road elements are textured using different colors.
- Navigation controls to move the camera and adjust the view of the city.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- C++ compiler
- OpenGL library
- GLUT library

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rishuvro/Building_City_of_Gold_using_OPENGL_glut.git


2. Compile the source code:

g++ main.cpp -o city_of_gold -lGL -lGLU -lglut


3. Run the executable:

./city_of_gold


4. Use the following controls to navigate the city:

- 'w' key: Move the camera up.
- 's' key: Move the camera down.
- 'a' key: Move the camera left.
- 'd' key: Move the camera right.
- 'i' key: Move the camera look up.
- 'k' key: Move the camera look down.
- 'j' key: Move the camera look left.
- 'l' key: Move the camera look right.
- '+' key: Zoom in.
- '-' key: Zoom out.
